# BMS-InputManager

## Unity Event-Based Input Manager

**Version: v1.2.0**

This repository provides an event-driven input management system for Unity using the **Unity Input System**. It simplifies input handling by exposing events for various gamepad controls, allowing developers to subscribe and react to inputs efficiently.

The input action map is created for gamepad primarily. Keyboard bindings are added but require custom mapping and configuration depending on your input control requirements.

## Features

- Event-driven input handling for gamepads.
- Supports all standard controller inputs (buttons, sticks, triggers, and D-pad).
- Simple subscription model for listening to input events.
- Frame-precise button state tracking via `InputActionState` (pressed, held, released).
- High-level `InputManager` aggregates all states in one place.
- Debugging utilities to log inputs in real-time.
- Real-time gamepad visualiser scene included.

## Architecture

The system is structured in four layers:

| Layer | Class | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Event Distribution | `InputHandler` | Reads from `PlayerInput`, fires 50+ C# events |
| State Aggregation | `InputManager` | Subscribes to `InputHandler`, maintains `InputActionState` per button |
| State Tracking | `InputActionState` | Frame-precise pressed / held / released detection |
| Debug & Visualisation | `InputDebugger`, `InputVisualiser` | Logging and real-time visual feedback |

Example scripts (`InputJumpExample`, `InputMoveExample`, `InputEventSubscriptionExample`) demonstrate how to consume the system in gameplay code.

## Scene Examples

| Scene | Description |
|---|---|
| `Scene-GamepadInputVisualiser` | Displays active gamepad inputs in real-time |
| `Scene-InputExample-Gamepad&Keyboard` | Debug inputs from gamepad and keyboard |
| `Scene-LocalMultiplayer` | Uses `PlayerInputManager` to handle multiple players / devices |
| `Scene-LocalMultiplayerSplitScreen` | Multiple players with split-screen using `PlayerInputManager` |
| `Scene-SinglePlayer-AnyDevice` | Accepts input from any connected device |

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup

Ensure you have the **Unity Input System** package installed:

1. Open **Package Manager** (`Window > Package Manager`).
2. Search for **Input System** and install it.
3. Go to `Edit > Project Settings > Player` and set **Active Input Handling** to `Both` or `Input System Package`.

### 2. Adding the Input Handler

1. Attach the `InputHandler` script to a **GameObject** in your scene.
2. The `InputHandler` requires a `PlayerInput` component on the same GameObject — assign your **Input Action Asset** (`InputSystem_Actions_BMS.inputactions`) to it.
3. Optionally add `InputManager` to the same GameObject; it will auto-assign the `InputHandler` reference and aggregate all button states.

### 3. Subscribing to Input Events

`InputHandler` events are **instance** events, so subscribe to a specific `InputHandler` reference
(not the type). Always use **named** handler methods — subscribing with a lambda and trying to `-=`
it later silently fails to unsubscribe and leaks the handler.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class MyInputReceiver : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private InputHandler inputHandler; // assign the player's InputHandler

    private void OnEnable()
    {
        inputHandler.OnButtonSouth += HandleButtonSouth;
        inputHandler.OnLeftStick += HandleLeftStick;
    }

    private void OnDisable()
    {
        // Same named methods, so -= actually removes them.
        inputHandler.OnButtonSouth -= HandleButtonSouth;
        inputHandler.OnLeftStick -= HandleLeftStick;
    }

    private void HandleButtonSouth() => Debug.Log("Button South Pressed");
    private void HandleLeftStick(Vector2 input) => Debug.Log($"Left Stick: {input}");
}
```

See [InputEventSubscriptionExample.cs](Scripts/Examples/InputEventSubscriptionExample.cs) for a complete reference covering all inputs, and [InputUsageStylesExample.cs](Scripts/Examples/InputUsageStylesExample.cs) for events and polling side by side.

### 4. Using InputManager for Frame-Precise State

`InputManager` exposes per-button `InputActionState` properties that let you query state within `Update`:

```csharp
[SerializeField] private InputManager _inputManager;

private void Update()
{
    if (_inputManager.ButtonSouth.Pressed())   // true only on the frame of press
        Jump();

    if (_inputManager.ButtonSouth.Held())      // true while held
        ChargeJump();

    if (_inputManager.ButtonSouth.Released())  // true only on the frame of release
        ReleaseJump();
}
```

### 5. Interactions (Tap / Hold / Slow Tap / Multi-Tap)

Every button-style `InputActionState` on `InputManager` also exposes higher-level interactions,
so you can just poll the ones you need from `Update`:

| Method | Returns true when |
|---|---|
| `Hold(duration = default)` | **Once**, after the button has been held past the hold time |
| `HoldActive(duration = default)` | **Every frame** while held past the hold time (charge-while-held) |
| `Tap(maxDuration = default)` | On release of a quick press |
| `SlowTap(minDuration = default)` | On release of a long press |
| `MultiTap(count = 2, maxTapDuration = default)` | When `count` quick taps occur in succession (e.g. double-tap) |

```csharp
private void Update()
{
    if (_inputManager.ButtonSouth.Tap())      Confirm();
    if (_inputManager.ButtonSouth.Hold())     OpenRadialMenu();   // one-shot
    if (_inputManager.ButtonSouth.MultiTap(2)) Dash();            // double-tap
}
```

Default timings are read from **Project Settings → Input System Package** (tap, hold, slow tap and
multi-tap delay), so they stay consistent with Unity's own interactions; each method also accepts an
optional override. These apply to all button states — face buttons, shoulders, stick presses, d-pad,
the digital stick directions, the trigger presses, and start/select. See
[InputInteractionExample.cs](Scripts/Examples/InputInteractionExample.cs).

## Events vs Polling — which to use

The asset gives you two ways to read input. They overlap, but they aren't equal in capability.

| | **Events** (`InputHandler`) | **Polling** (`InputManager` / `InputActionState`) |
|---|---|---|
| Style | "Push" — subscribe and react | "Pull" — read every frame in `Update` |
| Covers | Analog values, pressed, canceled/released | Pressed, Held, Released **+** Tap, Hold, HoldActive, SlowTap, MultiTap |
| Interactions (tap/hold/…) | ❌ not available | ✅ only here |
| Lifecycle | Must subscribe/unsubscribe (or leak) | Nothing to manage |
| Best for | Discrete, decoupled, UI-style reactions | Continuous logic and anything using interactions |

**Rule of thumb:** default to **polling** for gameplay entities — it does everything and can't leak —
and use **events** for discrete, decoupled, or UI reactions where "push" is cleaner. Mixing both is
perfectly fine; pick per use-case. See [InputUsageStylesExample.cs](Scripts/Examples/InputUsageStylesExample.cs).

**Gotchas:**
- **Poll edges in `Update`, not `FixedUpdate`.** `Pressed()`/`Released()`/`Tap()` etc. edge-detect
  against the frame count; `FixedUpdate` can run zero or several times per frame and would miss or
  double them. For physics, read/cache the input in `Update` and apply forces in `FixedUpdate`.
- **Don't do physics inside an event handler** — events fire at input-processing time, not during your
  game loop. Cache the value (see the stick pattern in the examples) and apply it in your loop.
- **Events need disciplined unsubscribe** in `OnDisable`, using named methods (not lambdas).

## Local Multiplayer

The asset is local-multiplayer-safe — `InputHandler`'s events are **per-instance** and it holds no
static state, so each player is fully independent.

- Give **each player prefab** its own `PlayerInput` + `InputHandler` (+ optional `InputManager`).
  Unity's `PlayerInput` hands each player a separate copy of the actions asset, paired to that
  player's device, so inputs never cross over.
- Subscribe to **that player's** `InputHandler` instance — never a global/static reference. Per-player
  gameplay scripts on the prefab can auto-wire to their own handler with `GetComponent` in `Awake`.
- See `Scene-LocalMultiplayer` and `Scene-LocalMultiplayerSplitScreen`, which use Unity's
  `PlayerInputManager` to spawn players per device.

### Cameras & split-screen

This asset handles **input only** — it does not manage cameras. For split-screen, each instanced
player needs its **own** camera, wired manually on the player prefab:

- Put a **Camera + `CinemachineBrain`** on each player prefab (not one shared Main Camera). A single
  Brain only drives one Unity camera, so N players need N cameras, each with its own Brain.
- Add a **Cinemachine camera (vcam)** on the prefab and set its **Follow / Look At** to that player's
  transform **at runtime** — the prefab is instanced, so the target only exists after the player spawns.
- Keep each player's vcam talking only to that player's Brain:
  - **Cinemachine 3.x:** give each player a unique **Channel** — set the vcam's *Output Channel* and the
    Brain's *Channel Mask* to match (assigned by player index on spawn).
  - **Cinemachine 2.x:** put each player's vcam on a unique **Layer** and set each camera's
    **Culling Mask** so a Brain only considers its own player's vcam.
- Let **`PlayerInputManager`** arrange the viewports: enable its **Split-Screen** option and it lays out
  each player camera's viewport rect automatically.
- **Only one camera may be tagged `MainCamera`.** Multiple Main Cameras (or relying on `Camera.main`)
  is the usual cause of "the player camera doesn't follow" — give each player camera its own Brain and a
  unique channel/layer rather than leaning on a shared Main Camera.

A working example is included: **`PlayerCameraChannelExample.cs`** (attach to the player prefab root)
assigns each player a unique Cinemachine channel by player index on spawn, which is what
`Scene-LocalMultiplayerSplitScreen` uses.

> **Note:** this still requires the manual per-prefab wiring above — the example covers the common case,
> but anything more advanced (camera framing, UI per player, etc.) is up to your game. Camera setup is
> intentionally out of scope for an input asset.

> **Planned improvement:** automatic camera + join/leave management (see below) so this wiring is
> handled for you.

> **Planned improvement:** a `PlayerInputManager` bridge that exposes join/leave events and a
> per-player registry to formalise joining/leaving. Not included yet — today you wire the player
> prefab (`PlayerInput` + `InputHandler`) and `PlayerInputManager` handles the spawning.
